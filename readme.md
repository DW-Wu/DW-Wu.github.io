# Welcome to D. Wu's site!

I would post about my personal interests, such as mathematics or classical music. I don't want to get involved in HTML too much, so I will just keep appending stuff to this Markdown file.

1. Listen to Dvořák's piano quintet in A major, Opus 81! It has beautiful melodies in all its four movements. Gratitudes to the comrades in the piano club, who introduced me to this piece.

2. The advanced piano technique exercises by Hungarian composer [Ernő Dohnányi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_von_Dohn%C3%A1nyi), which features exercises that train you in finger independence, scales, arpeggios, double stops and many more. The complete score is available on [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Essential_Finger_Exercises_(Dohn%C3%A1nyi%2C_Ern%C5%91)).
Don't practice too hard, though, since the exercises within may strain your fingers.
