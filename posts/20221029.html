                    The advanced piano technique exercises by Hungarian composer Ernő Dohnányi, which features exercises
                    that train you in finger independence, scales, arpeggios, double stops and many more. The complete
                    score is available on IMSLP. Don't practice too hard, though, since the exercises within may strain
                    your fingers. A more elementary set is Hanon, which you should play at least once a day, or whenever
                    you have the time to practice if you are a hobby pianist like me.
